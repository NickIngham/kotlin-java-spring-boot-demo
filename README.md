# kotlin-java-spring-boot-demo

This is a demo of 2 identical APIs, one written in Java and the other in kotlin to help highlight the differences between the 2 languages when using spring boot. To help highlight some of the differences there are also different controllers that highlight the benefits and drawbacks between the 2 languages.

This demo won't teach the basics of the Kotlin langauage, just highlighting the main benefits and drawbacks

### important note

to help keep this fair I have am only importing the H2 dependancy into each as this is about comparing the languages themselves. The main one I am avoiding lombok as adding the lombok framework does vastly reduce the differences, by introducing a wide variety of annotations reducing boiler plate code in Java

### Further reading

The article below is great for highlighting the benefits and drawbacks between Kotlin and Java. In my opinion, kotlin shouldn't be treated as a replacement for Java and should be treat as a language of its own right.
