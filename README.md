# kotlin-java-spring-boot-demo
This is a demo of 2 identical APIs, one written in Java and the other in kotlin to help highlight the differences between the 2 languages when using spring boot

### important note
to help keep this fair I have am only importing the H2 dependancy into each as this is about comparing the languages themselves.  The main one is lombok as adding the lombok framework does vastly reduce the differences, by introducing a wide variety of annotations
